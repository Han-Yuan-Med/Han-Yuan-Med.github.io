Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has grown rapidly with the development of backbone feedforward neural networks (FNNs). However, there remains a theoretical gap when researchers conduct error analysis of the FNNs-based RL process. In this work, we provide an error analysis for deep-fitted Q-iteration applying  ReLU-activated FNNs for value function approximation.
