A novel interpretable machine learning-based framework to automate the development of a clinical scoring model for predefined outcomes. Our novel framework consists of six modules: variable ranking with machine learning, variable transformation, score derivation, model selection, domain knowledge-based score fine-tuning, and performance evaluation.The details are described in our research paper<doi:10.2196/21798>. Users or clinicians could seamlessly generate parsimonious sparsescore risk models (i.e., risk scores), which can be easily implemented and validated in clinical practice. We hope to see its application in various medical case studies.
