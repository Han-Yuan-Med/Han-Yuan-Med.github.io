Clinical scores are highly interpretable and widely used in clinical risk stratification. AutoScore was previously developed as a clinical score generator, integrating the interpretability of clinical scores and the discriminability of machine learning (ML). Although a basic framework has been established, AutoScore leaves room for enhancement: variable ranking via the random forest and manual model selection. In this work, we improved them with additional variable ranking methods and an automatic model selection. We demonstrated that these updates generate clinical scores with fewer variables and higher accuracy.
