Hi! I am Han. I received double B.S. degrees in Biology and Applied Mathematics (ranking: 1st/79) from **Nankai University**, where I participated in several projects about operations research, medical informatics, and evolutionary biology. Subsequently, I worked as a research scholar at **Harvard University** concentrating on epidemiology and biostatistics. After that, I pursued my Ph.D. in Health Data Science at **Duke-NUS Medical School** (an inter-institutional collaboration between **Duke University** and **National University of Singapore**), during which time I exchanged at and **Universität Zürich**. My industry experiences include data analytics internships at **Bank of China**, **Founder Securities**, **Brigham Health**, and **Universitätsspital Zürich**.

My current research interests focus on [Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) and [Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning) in Healthcare. I am also widely interested in the frontiers of machine intelligence, especially advances in computer vision and natural language processing.

I am always happy to try different milk tea brands and flavors. Whether looking for a research collaborator or milk tea partner, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:yuan.han@u.duke.nus.edu">contact me</a>.
