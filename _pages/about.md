Hi! I am Han. I received double B.S. degrees in Biology and Applied Mathematics (ranking: 1st/79) from **Nankai University**, where I participated in several projects about operations research, medical informatics, and evolutionary biology. Subsequently, I worked as a research scholar at **Harvard University** concentrating on epidemiology and biostatistics. After that, I pursued my Ph.D. in Health Data Science at **Duke-NUS Medical School** (an inter-institutional collaboration between **Duke University** and **National University of Singapore**), during which time I exchanged at **Universität Zürich**. My industry experiences include data analytics internships at **Bank of China** and **Founder Securities**.

My current research interests focus on [Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) and [Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning) in Healthcare. I am also widely interested in the frontiers of machine intelligence, especially advances in computer vision and natural language processing.

Also, the idea of travel, packing my bags, and disappearing to someplace new, lives inside my brain allllll the time. I explored 20+ countries and was fascinated by the magical landforms like [volcano](/files/travel/volcano.jpg) that [burns blue](/files/travel/blue_fire.jpg), [glacier](/files/travel/glacier.jpg) at [the end of the earth](/files/travel/earth_end.jpg), [pink ocean](/files/travel/pink_lake.jpg) in a [barren saline land](/files/travel/barren.jpg), [black sand beach](/files/travel/black_beach.jpg) with [crashing waves](/files/travel/waves.jpg), [aurora](/files/travel/aurora.jpg) [dancing across the skies](/files/travel/aurora_dancing.jpg), etc. Whether looking for a research collaborator or travel partner, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:yuan.han@u.duke.nus.edu">contact me</a>.
