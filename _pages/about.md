Hi🙋🏻! I am Han. Throughout my journey, I have been driven by a passion for advancing knowledge in healthcare👨🏻‍⚕️. I am particularly interested in the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and epidemiology, and I strive to develop innovative methodologies and models that inform evidence-based decision-making and improve health outcomes. I also have a keen interest in the latest breakthroughs in machine intelligence🤖, particularly in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing.

Also, the idea of traveling🗺️, packing my bags🧳, and disappearing to someplace new🛸, lives inside my brain all the time🧠. I have journeyed to over 20 countries and have been spellbound by the surreal natural wonders, including [the blue-burning🔥]((/files/travel/blue_fire.jpg)) [volcano🌋](/files/travel/volcano.jpg), [the glacier🧊](/files/travel/glacier.jpg) at [the end of the earth🌎](/files/travel/earth_end.jpg), [the pink ocean🦩](/files/travel/pink_lake.jpg) in [the barren saline land🌵](/files/travel/barren.jpg), [the black sand beach🐚](/files/travel/black_beach.jpg) with [crashing waves🌊](/files/travel/waves.jpg), and [the auroras🌌](/files/travel/aurora.jpg) [dancing across the skies🌃](/files/travel/aurora_dancing.jpg).
