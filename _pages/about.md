Hi! I am Han, a Ph.D. student in Health Data Science at [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/). I received double B.S. degrees in Biology and Applied Mathematics (ranking: 1st/79) from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/), where I participated in several projects like adverse drug reaction analysis, children’s medical abnormal development analysis, ambulances' layout and dispatch, genomic adaptation of species members in fig wasp community, etc. Subsequently, I worked as a research scholar at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html), concentrating on epidemiology and medical informatics, respectively. My industry experiences include two business analytics internships at [Bank of China](https://www.boc.cn/en/) and [Founder Securities](https://www.foundersc.com/) and two medical data analytics internships at [Brigham Health](https://www.brighamhealth.org/) and [Universitätsspital Zürich](https://www.usz.ch/en/).

My current research interests focus on [Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) and [Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning) in Healthcare. I am also widely interested in the frontiers of machine intelligence, especially advances in computer vision and natural language processing.

I am always happy to try different milk tea brands and flavors. Whether looking for a research collaborator or milk tea partner, do not hesitate to contact me.
